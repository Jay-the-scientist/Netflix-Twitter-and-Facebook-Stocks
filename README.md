# Python-for-Data-Visualization-Matplotlib-Seaborn
This project is part of the Coursera Project Network and focuses on mastering data visualization using Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Project Overview
In this hands-on project, I learned to:
•	Generate various types of plots: line plots, scatterplots, histograms, pie charts, 3D plots, pair plots, count plots, and heatmaps.
•	Analyze stock data from Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), and Twitter (TWTR) spanning from 2013 to 2020, identifying key trends and insights.
Separately I learned to:
•	Utilize Seaborn and sklearn datasets to analyze breast cancer data, exploring feature correlations and target variables.
## Key Skills and Tools
•	Matplotlib: Created detailed and customizable plots.
•	Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization with advanced statistical plots.
•	Pandas: Managed and manipulated datasets efficiently.
•	sklearn: Imported and analyzed datasets, focusing on feature-target relationships.
## Learning Outcomes
•	Developed a strong foundation in data visualization techniques.
•	Gained practical experience in analyzing real-world datasets.
•	Enhanced ability to communicate data insights effectively through visualizations.
